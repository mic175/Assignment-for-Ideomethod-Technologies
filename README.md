# Luxury Yacht Rentals — Responsive React SPA

A responsive, single-page application for a luxury yacht rental service.
Originally built in plain HTML/CSS, the project has been migrated to React (Vite) with client-side routing and GitHub Pages deployment.

# Why this exists

A take-home challenge to convert a static landing page into a small multi-page app (SPA) while keeping the original look/feel, accessibility, and responsiveness — and to demonstrate modern tooling and deployment.

# Tech stack

- React 19 + Vite (fast dev server & bundling)

- React Router for client-side navigation

- CSS (no frameworks) for clarity and easy review

- gh-pages for one-command deployment to GitHub Pages

# App routes

- / – Home (hero + value props)

- /fleet – Rent a Yacht (yacht cards/specs/pricing)

- /services – Services (catering, water sports, routes, maintenance)

- /contact – Contact (phone, email, location + mailto CTA)

Refresh on sub-routes works via a 404.html copy step in deployment.
